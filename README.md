### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Diego, i'm a developer, currently the language I'm most proficient in is PHP, but I sometimes play with Java, Javascript and C++.
As you can see, my repository is quite varied, I develop for embedded systems (C++), Web (PHP, Laravel and Vue), Desktop (Java, Javascript - Electron) and Mobile (Vue and react Native)
I really like learning, I have a very broad field of interest, it's a shame that I don't have that much time to dedicate myself to everything I want.
I'm currently studying Solidity and English.
